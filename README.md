Transform any image into one made of dice
----------

Somewhere along 2020 I felt the desire to buy 600 dice to make a portrait made of (duh) dice. However, it dawned on me that I needed to know exactly which face of each dice in each position should be facing up, and thus I started coding this mf. At the time I was taking classes of Medical Image Processing in my Biomedical Engineering course, so I was ready to equalize everything and everyone.

If only I knew I needed way more than 600 dice... :P

### Features:
- load and save any image!
- resize the image by telling how much dice you wanna use!
- choose if the dice will be black with white dots or white with black dots
- use normalization or equalization to process the image
- do everything again if you're not satisfied!

----------
Everything still runs entirely from the terminal.

The more dices, the better!

Todos: create a GUI, make the final image be made by actual dices (and not a 9x9 matrix), implement video converting, remember user dim-color-process preferences for quick conversion, make .exe.
